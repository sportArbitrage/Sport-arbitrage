# Unpushed Commits Analysis

## Summary
I've analyzed the local git repository to identify any unpushed commits on the local machine. Here are the findings:

## Current Repository Status

**Repository**: sportArbitrage/Sport-arbitrage  
**Current Branch**: `cursor/check-for-unpushed-local-commits-c3ad`  
**Working Tree**: Clean (no uncommitted changes)

## Branch Analysis

### Local Branches
- `cursor/check-for-unpushed-local-commits-c3ad` (current, HEAD at 5b6c60a)
- `main` (tracking origin/main, up to date)

### Remote Branches
- `origin/main` (matches local main)
- `origin/master` 
- `origin/cursor/push-latest-changes-to-github-d0f3` (newly discovered remote branch)
- `origin/HEAD` ‚Üí `origin/main`

## Unpushed Commits Found

### 1. Current Branch Not Pushed
**Branch**: `cursor/check-for-unpushed-local-commits-c3ad`
- **Status**: This entire branch exists only locally and has never been pushed to remote
- **Commits ahead of origin/main**: 0 (branch is at same commit as origin/main)
- **Action needed**: The branch itself needs to be pushed to create it on remote

**Push command would be**:
```bash
git push origin cursor/check-for-unpushed-local-commits-c3ad
```

### 2. Branch Content Analysis
The current branch `cursor/check-for-unpushed-local-commits-c3ad` is at commit `5b6c60a` which corresponds to "Add over/under goals arbitrage logic". This commit **IS** already present on `origin/main`, so there are no unique commits on this branch.

## Key Findings

‚úÖ **No unpushed commits with unique content** - All commits on local branches are already present on remote branches  
‚ùó **One unpushed branch** - The current branch `cursor/check-for-unpushed-local-commits-c3ad` exists only locally  
üîÑ **Repository is synced** - Local `main` branch is up to date with `origin/main`  

## Recommendations

1. **Push the current branch** if you want to preserve it on remote:
   ```bash
   git push origin cursor/check-for-unpushed-local-commits-c3ad
   ```

2. **Alternative**: If this branch was just for investigation, you can safely delete it:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git branch -d cursor/check-for-unpushed-local-commits-c3ad
   ```

## Additional Notes

- A new remote branch `origin/cursor/push-latest-changes-to-github-d0f3` was discovered during the analysis
- The repository appears to be well-maintained with regular pushes to remote
- No uncommitted changes or stashes were found
